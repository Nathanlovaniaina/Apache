# Steps to Build an HTTP Server in Java

## 1. Understand the HTTP Protocol Basics
- [x] Learn the structure of HTTP requests and responses (e.g., headers, status codes, methods).

## 2. Setup a Java Project
- [x] Create a new Java project with the necessary structure.
- [x] Import required classes (`java.net.*`, `java.io.*`).

## 3. Socket Programming Basics
- [x] Use a `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming connections.
- [x] Accept connections using `Socket`.
- [x] Use `InputStream` to read client requests and `OutputStream` to send responses.

## 4. Parse HTTP Requests
- [x] Read the raw HTTP request from the client.
- [x] Extract information like the request method, URI, and headers.

## 5. Generate HTTP Responses
- [x] Send proper HTTP responses with headers and body.
- [x] Handle common content types (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).

## 6. Serve Static and Dynamic Content
- [x] Implement logic to serve static files like `index.html`.
- [ ] Add support for dynamic content (e.g., generating HTML on the fly).

## 7. Handle HTTP Methods
- [x] **GET**:
  - [x] Read query strings, fetch resources, and return them.
- [x] **POST**:
  - [x] Read and process the request body.

## 8. Error Handling
- [x] Send appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

## 9. Multithreading (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Allow the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously using threads.

## 10. Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Test the server using tools like **Postman** or a web browser.
- [ ] Optimize for performance and scalability.
